			<p class="intro">New York City stands at the epicenter of a nationwide crisis of affordable housing and an epidemic of homelessness. The United States is experiencing the highest levels of homelessness since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In August 2025, over one hundred thousand people slept each night in NYC shelters, and thousands more slept unsheltered on the streets of New York. The majority of the shelter population is families, with one third of that number being homeless children.

					 <p class="icon-subtext">1979</p>
					<figcaption class="graphic-text"> In the landmark class action lawsuit Callahan v. Carey, New York was established as a "Right to Shelter" state. The court mandated that New York state and local governments have a legal obligation to provide shelter to men experiencing homelessness. In the years following the decision, the right to shelter was extended to homeless women and families.

					<p class="icon-subtext">1990</p>
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">Mayor Rudy Giuliani required the City Planning Commission to adopt the “Fair Share” provision when siting shelters. The intended purpose was to evenly distribute city facilities among the districts, to ensure that communities are both “getting their fair share of amenities like parks and libraries and doing their fair share to confront citywide problems like homelessness".</figcaption>

					<p class="icon-subtext">2017</p>
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">Amidst a growing affordability crisis and historic rise in homelessness, Mayor Bill de Blasio set forth a “reimagined” plan for the placement of shelters. The approach would be “borough-based” in an attempt to avoid the displacement of people from their communities, employment and support networks. The city began opening shelters in high-need neighborhoods that already had a “significant number of existing sheltersß</figcaption>
