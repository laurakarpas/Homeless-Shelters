			<p class="intro"> New York City stands at the epicenter of a nationwide crisis of affordable housing and an epidemic of homelessness. In recent years, the city experienced the highest levels of homelessness since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In August 2025, over one hundred thousand people slept each night in NYC shelters, and thousands more slept unsheltered on the streets of New York.

			<!-- Regular body paragraph -->
			<p>
				Over the years, New York City has implemented a series of laws and approaches that govern why and where homeless shelters are placed:

					<figcaption class="graphic-text"> In the landmark class action lawsuit Callahan v. Carey, New York was established as a "Right to Shelter" state. The court ruled that New York state and local governments have a legal obligation to provide shelter to men experiencing homelessness. In the years following the decision, the right to shelter was extended to homeless women and families. Due to this law, New York City has one of the lowest levels of unsheltered people in the nation.

					<h4>Fair Share</h4>

					<p class="icon-subtext">1990</p>
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">Recognizing the disproportionate concentration of shelters in low income communities, the administration of Mayor Rudy Giuliani established the “Fair Share” guidelines. The stated purpose was to evenly distribute city facilities among the districts in an effort to ensure that communities are both “getting their fair share of amenities like parks and libraries and doing their fair share to confront citywide problems like homelessness". This approach placed new shelters in neighborhoods with few or no existing shelters in order to more evenly distribute them throughout the five boroughs.</figcaption>

					<h4>Borough-Based</h4>
					<img src="images/Final Images/Borough Based.png">
					<p class="icon-subtext">2017</p>
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">Amidst a growing affordability crisis and historic rise in homelessness, Mayor Bill de Blasio set forth a reimagined plan for the placement of shelters. The approach would be “borough-based” in an effort to avoid the displacement of people from their communities, employment and support networks. The city began opening shelters in high-need neighborhoods that already had a significant number of existing shelters.
