					<!-- Column description text -->
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">In 1979, New York was established as a “right to shelter” state in the landmark class action lawsuit Callahan v. Carey. The court established that New York state and local governments have a legal obligation to provide shelter to men experiencing homelessness, therefore the question is not whether shelters will be sited, but where they will be sited.

The approach would be “borough-based” in an attempt to avoid the displacement of people from their communities, employment and support networks. The city began opening shelters in high-need neighborhoods that already had a “significant number of existing sheltersß</figcaption>
